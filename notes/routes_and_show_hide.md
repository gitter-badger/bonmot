##Showing & Hiding / Routes
Interesting questions and thoughts around the two above. The initial thought was 'how would we best
control showing and hiding different child-views?'. This also implies questions about how routes
should be handled, and what mechanism we should do to show/hide elements; removed them from the dom, or set "display:none"?
